## Why use the simple scale?

The simple 1-8 scale is easy to explain and quick to remember. It is a good entry point for teams that are new to estimation.

Because it is linear, the steps feel even. That can be helpful early on, but it also makes it easier to drift into time-based thinking.

## Card sequence

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

## When it works best

- New teams learning the flow of Planning Poker
- Short, well-scoped tasks
- Backlogs where precision matters more than uncertainty

## How to run a round

1. Anchor the scale with a known 3 or 4.
2. Vote privately and reveal together.
3. If you are stuck between two numbers, pick the higher and move on.

## Watch-outs

- Linear scales invite hour conversion. Keep it relative.
- If you argue over 6 vs 7, widen the gaps.
