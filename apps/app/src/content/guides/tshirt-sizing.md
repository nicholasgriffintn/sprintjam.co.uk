## Why use T-shirt sizing?

T-shirt sizing is great for early sorting. Instead of debating numbers, you group work into XS to XL buckets and move on.

It is a strong fit for roadmap conversations, discovery work, or when you need to get a rough order before you know the detail.

## Card sequence

XS, S, M, L, XL.

## When it works best

- Product discovery and high-level roadmaps
- Mixed-discipline teams that need a common language
- Large backlogs that need quick grouping

## How to run a round

1. Set a reference example for M.
2. Ask the team to vote privately.
3. Reveal, discuss, and settle on a single size.
4. Split anything that feels like an XL.

## Watch-outs

- T-shirt sizes do not translate neatly into velocity.
- Switch to points once stories are well understood.
