## Why use Fibonacci short?

Fibonacci short keeps the spirit of relative sizing but cuts the tail. It is quicker to choose between seven cards than ten, which makes it a good default for sprint planning.

It is also easier to calibrate with new teams. The gaps still widen as work grows, but you avoid long debates about very large numbers.

## Card sequence

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.

## When it works best

- Teams that want fast decisions during refinement
- Backlogs with mostly small-to-mid sized stories
- Groups that are still building a shared reference story

## How to run a round

1. Read the story and acceptance criteria.
2. Let everyone pick a card privately.
3. Reveal together and talk through the highs and lows.
4. Re-vote once the assumptions are aligned.

## Watch-outs

- Big items still need splitting; 21 is a signal, not a destination.
- If you keep picking 13 or 21, it may be time for a wider scale.
