## The problem with hours

Time-based estimation sounds simple: "This will take four hours." It rarely works that way.

- **Individual variation** - A senior developer's four hours can be a junior's twelve.
- **Optimism bias** - We routinely underestimate.
- **Commitment pressure** - Hour estimates turn into deadlines.
- **Context switching** - Four hours of work rarely happens in four straight hours.

Story points avoid this by removing time from the conversation.

## What story points actually measure

Points are a relative measure of effort, complexity, and uncertainty combined. They answer one question: "How big is this compared to other work we have done?"

A 5-point story is not five hours or five days. It is "about the same size as that other 5-point story." That relativity is the whole idea.

### The three factors

- **Effort** - How much work is involved?
- **Complexity** - How hard is the problem?
- **Uncertainty** - How much do we not know?

A story can be high-effort but low-complexity, or small but uncertain. Points capture the combined size.

## Velocity: the bridge to planning

If points are not time, how do you plan? Use velocity.

Velocity is the number of points your team completes per sprint. After a few sprints, a pattern appears:

- Sprint 1: 23 points
- Sprint 2: 27 points
- Sprint 3: 21 points
- Sprint 4: 25 points

Your velocity is roughly 24 points per sprint. Now you can plan without ever converting points to hours.

## Why relative sizing works better

Humans are poor at absolute estimation and good at comparison. It is easier to say "this is a bit bigger than that" than to predict exact duration. A shared reference story makes this fast and consistent.

## Calibrating your team

New teams should calibrate explicitly:

1. **Pick a reference story** - Choose a completed, typical item. "The password reset was a 3."
2. **Estimate a few together** - Compare new work to the reference.
3. **Track and adjust** - Review after each sprint and recalibrate.
4. **Recalibrate when the team changes** - New members or new tech shift the baseline.

## Common traps

### The hours conversion trap

"A point is about four hours" turns points back into hours. Resist it. If someone asks for time, explain that velocity provides capacity without a direct conversion.

### The individual assignment trap

Points are team estimates, not individual commitments. A 5-point story should be about the same size no matter who picks it up. Differences in skill show up in velocity, not in points.

### The precision trap

If you are debating 5 vs 6, you are already too precise. Use a scale with gaps and move on.

## When story points do not work

Consider alternatives when:

- **Work is highly uniform** - Counting tickets can be enough.
- **The team is very mature** - Throughput is stable without estimates.
- **The domain changes constantly** - Relative sizing has no anchor.
- **Stakeholders demand hours** - Sometimes the political cost is not worth it.

## The bottom line

Story points are not magic. They are a tool for relative sizing. Stop asking "How long will this take?" and start asking "How big is this compared to what we have done before?" Let velocity translate that into planning capacity.
