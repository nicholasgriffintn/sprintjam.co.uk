## Why roles matter

Estimation sessions drift when nobody is steering. Clear roles keep the meeting focused, stop loud voices from dominating, and make sure decisions are captured. These roles are not hierarchy. They are service to the team, and they should rotate.

## The Facilitator

The Facilitator owns the process, not the estimate.

### Responsibilities

- **Set the agenda** - Share the order of items and the timeboxes.
- **Keep time** - Move the group along when discussion stalls.
- **Manage the reveal** - Trigger the vote reveal and call out the spread.
- **Draw out outliers** - Ask high and low voters to explain first.
- **Call for re-votes** - Decide when to vote again or accept a value.
- **Protect quiet voices** - Invite people who have not spoken.

### Tips

- **Stay neutral** - If you vote, do it last and without commentary.
- **Use a parking lot** - Capture tangents instead of chasing them.
- **Watch energy** - Take breaks when the team is fading.

## The Scribe

The Scribe captures decisions and assumptions so they do not get lost.

### Responsibilities

- **Record final estimates** - Note the agreed value for each item.
- **Capture assumptions** - "We assume the API already exists."
- **Track follow-ups** - Questions that need answers before work starts.
- **Note scope changes** - "We agreed this excludes the admin view."
- **Share notes after** - Update the backlog tool and send a summary.

### Tips

- **Use a shared doc** - Let everyone see and correct notes live.
- **Keep it brief** - Capture decisions, not the whole debate.
- **Tag owners** - Follow-ups should have names attached.

## The Product Owner

The Product Owner provides context and clarifies scope. They do not estimate.

### Responsibilities

- **Present items** - Explain the story and acceptance criteria.
- **Answer questions** - Clarify scope, constraints, and priorities.
- **Accept scope changes** - Help split or trim when needed.
- **Stay out of the estimate** - Do not anchor the team.

### Tips

- **Prepare acceptance criteria** - It saves time in-session.
- **Bring context, not solutions** - Let the team choose the how.
- **Be ready to cut scope** - Ask for the smallest useful version.

## Participants (Estimators)

Everyone who might touch the work should estimate.

### Responsibilities

- **Vote honestly** - Base it on your own understanding.
- **Explain outliers** - You might have spotted a hidden dependency.
- **Ask questions** - If something is unclear, say so before voting.
- **Stay engaged** - Fresh eyes often spot missing details.

### Tips

- **Think before the reveal** - Do not wait to see what others chose.
- **Use the "?" card** - It is fine to say you do not know.
- **Respect the timebox** - Be concise.

## Optional: The Timekeeper

For larger teams, a Timekeeper frees the Facilitator to focus on discussion.

### Responsibilities

- **Track per-item time** - Call out when the clock is nearly up.
- **Watch overall session time** - Keep the meeting on plan.
- **Call breaks** - Suggest a short pause after 45 to 50 minutes.

## Rotating roles

Rotating roles builds shared ownership and avoids burnout. One simple approach: rotate Facilitator each sprint, rotate Scribe each session.

## Role summary

| Participants | Estimate, explain, question | Yes |
| Timekeeper | Track time, call breaks | Yes |
