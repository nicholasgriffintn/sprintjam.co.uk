## Why use Yes/No cards?

Yes/No cards are for decisions, not estimation. They help the team answer a clear question quickly without slipping into a numbers debate.

Use them when the outcome is binary: ready or not, do or do not, pass or fail.

## Card sequence

Yes, No.

## When it works best

- Readiness checks before a release
- Policy or compliance confirmations
- Simple go/no-go decisions

## How to run a round

1. State the question in plain language.
2. Everyone votes privately.
3. Reveal together and discuss any No votes.

## Watch-outs

- Ambiguous questions create noisy results.
- If you hear "it depends", switch to a scale instead.

## Using Yes/No in {{SITE_NAME}}

Use this deck when you want a crisp decision and the question is already well defined.
