## Why use the doubling scale?

The doubling scale is blunt by design. Each step is twice the size of the last, which keeps conversations short when uncertainty is high.

It is useful early in discovery or when you are dealing with infrastructure work where the range matters more than the precision.

## Card sequence

2, 4, 8, 16, 32.

## When it works best

- Early-stage estimates with little detail
- Large technical initiatives where scope can shift
- Teams that need a fast, coarse signal

## How to run a round

1. Agree on what a 2 represents.
2. Vote privately and reveal together.
3. If the spread is wide, capture the risk and pick the safer number.

## Watch-outs

- You lose nuance for small work; use a tighter scale once stories are clearer.
- It can hide mid-range differences if everything feels like an 8.

## Using the doubling scale in {{SITE_NAME}}

Use this deck when the goal is speed and broad alignment rather than fine-grained accuracy.
