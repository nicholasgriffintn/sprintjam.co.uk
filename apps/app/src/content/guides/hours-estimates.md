## Why use hours?

Hours are a direct measure of time, so they can be useful for short-term scheduling or operational work where the tasks are well understood.

They are less effective for discovery work because they hide uncertainty and encourage false precision.

## Card sequence

2, 4, 8, 16, 24.

## When it works best

- Maintenance or support work with repeatable steps
- Small delivery windows where capacity matters
- Teams that have a stable baseline for time estimates

## How to run a round

1. Clarify the scope and boundaries.
2. Vote privately and reveal together.
3. Use the higher number when there is doubt.

## Watch-outs

- Hours can become personal commitments; keep them as team estimates.
- If uncertainty is high, switch to a relative scale.
