### Self-Hosting on Cloudflare

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/sprintjam.co.uk.git
   cd sprintjam.co.uk
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.dev.vars` file or configure in Cloudflare dashboard:

   ```env
   # Optional: Jira OAuth
   JIRA_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-jira-client-id
   JIRA_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-jira-client-secret
   JIRA_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/api/jira/oauth/callback

   # Optional: Linear OAuth
   LINEAR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-linear-client-id
   LINEAR_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-linear-client-secret
   LINEAR_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/api/linear/oauth/callback

   # Optional: GitHub OAuth
   GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
   GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
   GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/api/github/oauth/callback
   ```

   **To enable an external provider:**

   a. Create an OAuth 2.0 app with the provider (Atlassian Developer Console for Jira; Linear Developer Settings for Linear; GitHub Developer Settings for GitHub) and set the redirect URI to match the value above.  
   b. Add required scopes (Jira: `read:jira-work`, `write:jira-work`, `read:jira-user`, `offline_access`; GitHub: `repo`, `user:email`).  
   c. Copy the client ID/secret into the corresponding env vars.  
   d. In a room, open Settings → Other Options → External Provider and connect Jira, Linear, or GitHub.

4. **Deploy to Cloudflare**
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy
   ```
